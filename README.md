# Train_Accident_Prevention_project
This project is a simple but effective system designed to prevent train accidents by detecting obstacles on the railway track. Using an ultrasonic sensor, the Arduino continuously monitors the track ahead, and if an object is detected within a safe distance, the train motor stops immediately to avoid collision.
